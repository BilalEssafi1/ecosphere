Ecosphere is a social media platform designed to connect users who are passionate about sustainability and eco-friendly living. The platform allows users to share posts, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and engage in a community focused on environmental awareness. This project was developed as part of the Code Institute's fourth Project Portfolio.

# UX

## Goals and Target Audience
Ecosphere is designed for individuals who are passionate about sustainability and eco-friendly living. The website provides essential features for easy navigation, user engagement, and community building, suitable for individuals, families, and groups looking to connect and share their experiences and knowledge about environmental awareness.

## Design 
The Ecosphere website embraces a color palette inspired by nature, with earthy and inviting tones that reflect the theme of sustainability:

Green and Earthy Tones: Rich shades of green and earthy tones are used as primary colors, evoking the natural warmth and sophistication associated with environmental awareness.
Accents of Blue and White: These accents are used sparingly to highlight call-to-action buttons, enhancing user navigation while fitting the theme of sustainability and clarity.
Light and Airy Backgrounds: These tones provide a clean and welcoming background that contrasts beautifully with the deeper colors, ensuring readability and a visually pleasing experience.

This color scheme not only aligns with the theme of sustainability but also helps create an inviting, elegant atmosphere for users exploring the platformâ€™s offerings and engaging with the community.

## Database planning

## Final data structure

After refining the project and finalizing essential features, I created the database schema to accommodate specific requirements for user management, post creation, and community engagement. Using Creately, I visually outlined the final data structure, focusing on the User, Post, Comment, Like, and Profile tables, and their relationships.
